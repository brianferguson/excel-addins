# excel-addins

A collection of addins I made for Microsoft Office Excel. These scripts are tailored for my needs **only** and they are not meant to provide a solution to all users.

#### Addins:
* [titlebar-path](https://github.com/brianferguson/excel-addins/blob/master/titlebar-path/): This replaces the titlebar text to the full path of the workbook.

#### How to install:
1. Locate your addins folder. It is usually located in your AppData folder: `C:\Users\*Your_Name*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Addins\` (Note: The `AppData` folder may be hidden.)
2. Copy the `.xlam` to the addins folder.
3. You may have to "unblock" the file in some cases. To unblock the file, follow the instructions here: [https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5357-unblock-file-windows-10-a.html#option1](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5357-unblock-file-windows-10-a.html#option1)
